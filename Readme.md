# WebAssembly Starter Project / Boilerplate 

Simple boilerplate to compile and run `.wasm` files



## Development
You'll need to have EMSDK installed somewhere in your system. 
I would recommend downloading and installing 
[Portable Emscripten SDK](https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)
